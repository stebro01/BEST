HL7-CDA JSON details
....................

In our application, we've implemented support for HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) version 2.0.1, focusing specifically on the "Composition" resource type. This resource type allows us to encapsulate relevant patient and observational data within a structured JSON format.

The "Composition" resource is broken down into three main properties:

- "subject": This property holds identifiers and demographic information of the subject (e.g., patient) the data pertains to.
- "event": Captures any significant events or timestamps related to the captured data, such as time of data collection or modification. Herein `visits` are captured.
- "section": This is a container for the actual observational data or findings (`observations`). Each section could represent a different data category like vitals, lab results, or clinical observations.

Upon export, the system generates a JSON file compliant with HL7-CDA, compiling all the necessary information into the aforementioned properties. Conversely, during import, the system parses the JSON file, extracts data mapped to these properties, and populates the respective fields in our database.

.. NOTE:: 
   
   It's worth mentioning that our current implementation supports only the "Composition" resource type for HL7-CDA in JSON format.

An exemplary JSON file generated by the system is shown below:
